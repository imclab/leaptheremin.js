# leaptheremin.js

Leap Motion + Web Audio API theremin experiment. Inspired by
[mysteron.js](https://github.com/monospaced/mysteron.js), from which a
not-insignificant amount of audio code was borrowed.

Requires latest Chrome/Safari and LeapMotion v0.7.1+. Yep, that means
you have to have a Leap dev board.

Got all that? Try it out [here](http://zapnap.github.com/leaptheremin.js).

## Usage

* Mouse over the control area to activate the theremin and get started.
* The further away from the Leap, the higher the frequency generated.
* Adjust the volume level using the dial (responds to mouse scroll too).
* Close your first or mouse off the control area to temporarily pause the sound.
* Use the "[" and "]" keys to alternate between oscillator waveform types.
